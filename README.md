## Wheel of Fortune Re-creation

Based on my group's re-creation of an emotional therapy animation inspired by the Wheel of Fortune, I used the techniques of Perlin noise and randomness to make the animation move more naturally and smoothly, as if real emotions were flowing.

The circular curves are similar to the interweaving lines in the Wheel of Fortune, and I wrapped the curves in bubbles of different gradient colors to represent us who are often wrapped in emotions. The particles that keep exploding and disappearing are similar to the dots that flow in the Wheel of Fortune, representing every moment of our individual lives, which are wrapped in emotions but will eventually turn into dust. I hope that this work can give people a power of recovery, and also stimulate the audience to think about and understand their own emotions. Everyone has their own path in the wheel of fortune, and despite being held by emotions, every moment is unique and precious.
